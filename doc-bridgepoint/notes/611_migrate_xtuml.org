3. Background
-------------
From Mr. Starrett:

xtuml.org is hosted on a server we own and control.  This server is an instance hosted on Amazon Web Services.
xtuml.org is a web site.  We do not need it to run on a standalone server.
xtuml.org should be hosted in a hosting environment like GoDaddy.


Also from Mr. Starret: 

    Migrate xtuml.org from our current AWS-based hosting to a service provider (preferably GoDaddy unless something better is demonstrated).
    Interruptions in xtuml.org availability must be kept low.
        Interruptions of more than an hour are not acceptable.
    The cost of maintaining the site must be reduced.
        AWS costs something like $100+ per month.
        GoDaddy for onefact.net costs $1 per month.
        xtuml.org must cost less than $50 per month and preferably be around $1 per month.
    Minimize "departures from standards" that make the site difficult to maintain. Use off-the-shelf themes and plugins whenever practical.
    xtuml.net and xtuml.com exist. These will ultimately be forwarded to xtuml.org but could serve as a staging area.



4. Requirements
---------------
From Mr. Brown:

4.1 - The new website shall support the forum  
4.2 - The new website shall contain the existing forum topics & replies
4.3 - The new website shall support WP Courseware
4.4 - The new website shall maintain the progress of users in the courses
4.5 - Existing user registrations shall carry over to the new site
4.6 - The website shall include anti-spam measures on the forum and user registration

5. Analysis
-----------
From Mr. Guthrie:

5.1 - Preliminary analysis.  Mr. Mulvey and Mr. Starrett confirmed that an attempt was made to use the 
tool provided by GoDaddy.com to migrate the existing xtUML.org WordPress site to a GoDaddy.com host. However, 
this attempt was unsuccessful, so the migration project is still on-going.
5.2 - Initial research.  There is a function on the WordPress Dashboard called "Export".  According to [4], 
this function will download all content of the WordPress site to a local host. This data may be used as a file 
to "Import" on the new WordPress site hosted by GoDaddy.com by using the "Import" function on the WordPress Dashboard.
5.3 - Option 2.  Another option for migrating from the existing WordPress xtUML.org site to a site hosted by 
GoDaddy.com is to use the manual method as described in [3].  This method is more invovled because it involves 
working with the MySQL and PHPMyAdmin configurations.  Care must be taken here.
5.4 - Unknowns: Given the nature of WordPress and its use of plugins, it is not known if the plugins currently 
utilized by the xtUML.org WordPress site are specific to Amazon Web Services, or are non-premium 
(read: "freely available").  In response to the requirements in Section 4 above, questions regarding some of
the requirements arise:
5.4.1 - Does the proposed GoDaddy host support the existing forum plugin?  Is it freely available?
5.4.2 - Does the proposed GoDaddy host support the WP Courseware?  Is it freely available?
5.4.3 - Does the proposed GoDaddy host support the migration of existing user registrations?
5.5 - It seems likely that these features are supported by GoDaddy.com since all WordPress websites are designed to be 
compatible, but it is unknown for certain at the time of this writing.

6. Work Required
----------------
Proposed work: A simple and effective next step to migrate the existing xtUML.org website would be to use the existing 
xtUML.org WordPress site's Export feature from the Dashboard to create a backup of the existing xtUML.org website. 
Then this backup file may be imported to the proposed GoDaddy.com host.  When these steps are completed, it would be 
a matter of seeing what works on the new site and what does not.  The existing site remains unchanged with no 
downtime.

7. Acceptance Test
------------------
Project managers and the OneFact team may amend and approve or refine this proposed course of action.
